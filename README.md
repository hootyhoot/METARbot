# METARbot
A small discord bot to fetch METAR from most airfields in the world using the checkwx API.
Usage "*metar (4 Digit ICAO Code)"

ONLY FOR FLIGHTSIM/RECREATIONAL USE, NOT MEANT FOR REAL FLIGHTS

Some small airfields might not have METAR info due to them not having local weather stations so please keep that in mind. 
In the next update I will be adding a feature to search for the METAR from the nearest airport instead of returning an invalid message.
